# Loan Default Risk Analysis

A data analytics project focused on analyzing loan default risk using Excel, Python, and Power BI. The project emphasizes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to uncover key patterns and risk factors associated with loan defaults.

This repository demonstrates a structured, insight-driven analytics workflow suitable for academic and entry-level data analyst use cases.

## Project Overview

Loan defaults pose significant financial risks for banks and lending institutions. Understanding borrower behavior and identifying high-risk patterns are essential for improving lending decisions and reducing losses.

This project aims to answer questions such as:

• Which borrower and loan attributes are most associated with default?  
• How do income, loan amount, and credit history relate to default risk?  
• What patterns can help identify high-risk borrower segments?

The focus of this project is **analysis and insight generation**, not prediction or deployment.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains anonymized loan and borrower information.
